        <p><b>The peacock was named the National Bird of India in 1963 because it is the most auspicious animal that embodies our countryâ€™s fauna and has a long history of religious and legendary significance in Indian culture. The Peacock is a magnificent creature with its beauty and grace, and it embodies the national spirit whose colours are connected with Indian identity.</b></p>
        <p><b>The Indian peacock, Pavo cristatus, the national bird of India, is a colourful, swan-sized bird, with a fan-shaped crest of feathers, a white patch under the eye and a long, slender neck. The male of the species is more colourful than the female, with a glistening blue breast and neck and a spectacular bronze-green tail of around 200 elongated feathers. The female is brownish, slightly smaller than the male and lacks the tail. The elaborate courtship dance of the male, fanning out the tail and preening its feathers is a gorgeous sight.</b></p>
